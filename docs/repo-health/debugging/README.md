# Debugging Notes

This folder records significant local-development incidents and debugging sessions that are likely to matter again.

Use it for issues where the final fix is not obvious from code alone: broken local tooling, simulator problems, stale smoke scripts, dependency-cache failures, or anything where the sequence of failed attempts is useful context for future work.

Each note should include:

- date and affected area
- symptoms
- likely root cause
- what was tried
- what worked
- verification performed
- what to do next time
- any cleanup or follow-up risk

These notes are operational history, not product specs. Keep implementation plans in `docs/<domain>/plans/`, architecture contracts in `docs/orientation/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and broader conceptual explainers in `docs/orientation/explainers/`.

## Server Diagnostic Logs

Server-side diagnostics use `src/lib/diagnostics.ts` and print structured JSON strings to the normal server console. During local development, watch the terminal running `npm run dev`. In CI, inspect the relevant GitHub Actions command log. In deployed Vercel environments, inspect the runtime/function logs for the route or server action.

Use `trace_id` to group related events and `span_id` / `parent_span_id` to follow nested action/photo work. Use `duration_ms` on `*.finished` and `*.failed` events for timings. The default redaction contract is operational and sanitized: do not log raw user notes, emails, precise location, auth tokens, Supabase keys, full URLs with query strings, request bodies, photo data, or storage object paths.

Local JSONL files are appropriate only for explicit diagnostic runs where the console output is too hard to preserve or compare. Keep raw JSONL artifacts out of git by default; commit only summaries or short sanitized excerpts in a `DIAG-*` record.

## Diagnostic Records

Use `DIAG-*` diagnostic records when the question is:

> What happened in this real run, in what order, how long did each step take, and why did it fail or slow down?

`DIAG-*` is for run-level evidence: structured JSONL traces, crash logs, simulator/device logs, correlation IDs, timings, hypotheses ruled out, and a root cause or next instrumentation step. A session log records the human/agent work session; a diagnostic record records the execution path being investigated.

Raw traces are privacy-sensitive. Commit summaries and sanitized excerpts by default; keep raw logs, transcripts, media, payloads, and device traces local unless explicitly sanitized.

Do not create a new `DIAG-*` for routine debugging that is obvious after one command or one log line. Create one when the run involves user-visible failure, device/simulator specificity, privacy-sensitive logs, multiple hypotheses, added instrumentation, recurrence risk, or a result another agent may need to resume.

Create new diagnostic records with:

```bash
scripts/docs-meta new diag "<Title>" --domain <domain>
```

## Layout

- Future `DIAG-*` diagnostic records should live in this folder unless the repo later creates a dedicated `diagnostics/` subfolder.
- `map-manual-verification.md` records the repeatable manual checklist for Leaflet viewport, marker, geolocation, and keyboard checks.
